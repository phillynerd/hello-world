# hello-world

I'm Jess, a trained medical sociologist who left academia and stumbled into a career as a data scientist.  I'm a self professed nerd of many things, including R, data visualization, craft beer, Game of Thrones, and Jiu Jitsu.  I'm happily enjoying my life in Philly with my wife, our son, and all our amazing puppies.
